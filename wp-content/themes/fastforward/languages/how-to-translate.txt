There is a wide range of translation tools available in the gettext ecosystem. Some of the are listed on Wikipedia,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext#See_also). The general workflow is always the same:

Use the .pot template as the basis for translation. This will generate a new translation catalog (a .po file)
or updates an existing .po file.
Translate the strings (and plural forms) in your corresponding language.
Save the resulting .po and .mo files for the next step.

Transifex
By far the easiest option to translate is Transifex. This online service lets you get started quickly and does not
require you (or your translators) to install anything. This service is not free, but there are free plans available for
open-source projects.

Pootle
An alternative to Transifex is Pootle, a web interface for translations. Pootle can be rather difficult to setup though.

Poedit
The poedit application should be installed on your desktop, but is very easy to use (with one small exception).
Here's a step by step guide:

1. Download and install Poedit, which is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
2. Start Poedit and choose the "New Catalog from POT File..."
3. Open the /languages/en_US.pot file. This will open the "Catalog properties" dialog. Most of these options can be ignored,
except for the Language and Plural Forms fields:

You can find the correct value for these fields on this page http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/localization-guide/en/latest/l10n/pluralforms.html?id=l10n/pluralforms.
Warning: Be sure to check that you don't include a semicolon at the end of the plural-forms value, otherwise Poedit will not show the correct input boxes.

4. Save the new .po file somewhere in the /languages/ folder
5. Translate the strings.
6. Save your catalog and continue to the next step

Then you'll need to open wp-config.php file from the root folder of your WordPress install, and replace this line:

define ('WPLANG', '');

with something like:

define ('WPLANG', 'fr_FR');

Then make sure that .mo file from /languages/ folder of our theme has the same name as your language code: "fr_FR.mo"
